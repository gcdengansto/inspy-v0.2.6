=========

.. warning::
    New releases may not be backwards compatibile.

.. warning::
    Official support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 has been discontinued.




inspy is a python library with commonly used tools for neutron scattering measurements, primarily for Triple Axis Spectrometer data.

    * Triple Axis Spectrometer resolution function calculation (based on ResLib), including
        * Resolution ellipses
        * Convolution Fitting
    * Least-Squares fitting (custom interface for scipy.optimize.leastsq using lmfit features), including
        * Built-in physical models
    * GUI interface for Resolution Calculation and Resolution Convolution Fitting without coding
        * Two GUI interfaces for convolution fitting.



Inspy is a python package to conduct the resolution calculation for the inelastic neutron scattering experiment with triple-axis spectrometers. 
Inspy is developed on the basis of the python package Neutronpy, which was developed by David M Fobes by translating the functions in the MATLAB
 library Reslib3.4c by Andrew Zheludev. 
Inspy involves significant upgrades in comparison to Neutronpy. Inspy is able to do the 3D resolution calculation and plot 3D resolution functions, fit the triple-axis spectrometer
by convolting the instrument resolution. The bugs in the resolution calculation have been corrected. Two GUI interfaces were implemented to do the reolsution calcualtion and data fitting. 
inspy is a work-in-progress (see the `Roadmap <https://github.com/inspy/inspy/wiki/Roadmap>`_ in the wiki for indications of new upcoming features) and as such, still has many bugs, so use at your own risk; see Disclaimer. To report bugs or suggest features see Contributions.
